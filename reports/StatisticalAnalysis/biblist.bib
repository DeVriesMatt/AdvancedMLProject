abstract="Electrocardiogram is one important physiological signal, which is used in assessing cardiac health. The extraction of features used for identification of the state of ECG is discussed in this paper. Using MAT LAB programs/tools, different statistical features are extracted from both normal and arrhythmia spectra. These features include differentiation and count of spikes for different thresholds, mean, standard deviation, energy, residuals on curve fitting, LPC coefficients etc. The values of the feature vector reveal information regarding cardiac health state. These parameters have been analyzed for discrimination between normal and arrhythmia conditions. For analysis a specific data set has been considered.",

	Abstract = {Despite more than two decades of continuous development learning from imbalanced data is still a focus of intense research. Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

abstract="A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Recent years brought increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to difficult ``real-world'' problems, many of which are characterized by imbalanced data. Additionally the distribution of the testing data may differ from that of the training data, and the true misclassification costs may be unknown at learning time. Predictive accuracy, a popular choice for evaluating performance of a classifier, might not be appropriate when the data is imbalanced and/or the costs of different errors vary markedly. In this Chapter, we discuss some of the sampling techniques used for balancing the datasets, and the performance measures more appropriate for mining imbalanced datasets.",

@article{imb3,
	Abstract = {In a majority--minority classification problem, class imbalance in the dataset(s) can dramatically skew the performance of classifiers, introducing a prediction bias for the majority class. Assuming the positive (minority) class is the group of interest and the given application domain dictates that a false negative is much costlier than a false positive, a negative (majority) class prediction bias could have adverse consequences. With big data, the mitigation of class imbalance poses an even greater challenge because of the varied and complex structure of the relatively much larger datasets. This paper provides a large survey of published studies within the last 8 years, focusing on high-class imbalance (i.e., a majority-to-minority class ratio between 100:1 and 10,000:1) in big data in order to assess the state-of-the-art in addressing adverse effects due to class imbalance. In this paper, two techniques are covered which include Data-Level (e.g., data sampling) and Algorithm-Level (e.g., cost-sensitive and hybrid/ensemble) Methods. Data sampling methods are popular in addressing class imbalance, with Random Over-Sampling methods generally showing better overall results. At the Algorithm-Level, there are some outstanding performers. Yet, in the published studies, there are inconsistent and conflicting results, coupled with a limited scope in evaluated techniques, indicating the need for more comprehensive, comparative studies.},

abstract="This paper argues that severe class imbalance is not just an interesting technical challenge that improved learning algorithms will address, it is much more serious. To be useful, a classifier must appreciably outperform a trivial solution, such as choosing the majority class. Any application that is inherently noisy limits the error rate, and cost, that is achievable. When data are normally distributed, even a Bayes optimal classifier has a vanishingly small reduction in the majority classifier's error rate, and cost, as imbalance increases. For fat tailed distributions, and when practical classifiers are used, often no reduction is achieved.",
